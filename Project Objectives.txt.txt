In this project we are going to use ResNet-18 model to train it on Covid-19 radiography dataset from Kaggle named "Covid-19 Radiography Database". 
This dataset has roughly 3000 dimensions of Chest X-Ray Scans which are categorized in 3 classes Normal, Viral pneumonia and Covid-19. Our Objective
is to create an Image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scan that belongs to one of these 3 classes with a 
higher accuracy. We are going to use the concept of Convolutional neural networks, Optimization techniques as Gradient descent.

Project Objectives
In this Project, we are going to focus on the following objectives:

1.Create custom Dataset and DataLoader in PyTorch
2.Train a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch to perform Image Classification

The repository contains detailed code step by step:
Importing Libraries > Preparing Train and Test Sets > Creating Custom Datasets > Transform Image to Tensors > DataLoader preparation and Visualization > Training the Model
> Applying on Test dataset


The model we will train cannot however be used to diagnose Covid-19 as study related to Covid-19 is evolving. The dataset may
not be sufficient and there may be other hidden factors too. The diagnosis can only be succesfully done by trained medical 
professionals.
